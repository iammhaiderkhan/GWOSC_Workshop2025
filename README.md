# Gravitational Waves Open Science Center (GWOSC) Workshop 2025.
During the workshop, I gained hands-on experience with importing and working with time series data from different gravitational wave events, catalogs, and detectors. I learned how to transform time-domain data into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transforms, calculate the Power Spectral Density by averaging the squared moduli of the FFTs, and obtain the Amplitude Spectral Density by taking the square root of the PSD. I also explored visualizing the data through spectrograms and Q-transforms, which allowed me to examine the evolution of frequency content over time. Using PyCBC, I generated waveforms for merging binary systems with different approximants, masses, and arrival frequencies, enabling me to simulate and study a variety of astrophysical scenarios.

I further applied matched filtering techniques to identify known signals within whitened noise, learning the importance of preconditioning the data, accounting for filter wraparound, and interpreting the resulting SNR time series. Working with the GW170814 data, I implemented chi-squared tests to ensure that each p-bin contributed equally, helping to distinguish real signals from noise glitches, and re-weighted the SNR to account for deviations from Gaussian noise within the on-source window. Finally, I gained experience in Bayesian inference, including rejection sampling and running MCMC analyses using Bilby. For example, I ran Bilby on the GW150914 signal, fixing most parameters while allowing the chirp mass and a few others to vary, defining priors, and constructing a likelihood to perform the parameter estimation. These exercises collectively provided a deep, practical understanding of gravitational wave data analysis from raw time series to parameter inference.
